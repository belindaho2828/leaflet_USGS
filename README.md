# Summary

Leaflet was used to develop a visualization tool for earthquake data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The tool displays all earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or higher over the past 30 days worldwide.

## Key Features:

Interactive Map: The tool utilizes an interactive map to display earthquake data.

Marker Color: Each earthquake marker's color represents the depth of the earthquake.

Marker Size: The size of the markers correlates with the magnitude of the earthquake.

Tooltip Information: Users can hover over each marker to view details such as the location, depth, and magnitude of the earthquake.

## Purpose
The visualization tool serves to provide a meaningful representation of earthquake data collected by the USGS. By presenting the data in an interactive and visually engaging manner, the tool aims to educate the public and other government organizations about the frequency, intensity, and distribution of earthquakes worldwide. Ultimately, the tool seeks to raise awareness about natural hazards and the importance of monitoring and understanding seismic activity.

# Conclusion
Many of the deepest earthquakes are concentrated around the Pacific Ocean: west coast of South America, Fiji Islands, Tonga, and Alaska just to name a few regions. Governments should take this into account for city planning, emergency safety measures, and evacuation plans. We should take care to study how and if climate change affects this and communicate what preventative measures citizens need to take.
